### About

This project was meant to provide Andy with a project to learn full-stack javascript web development while building a useful tool for our company. The project started in March 2017 and was completed August 2017. During that time, the Studio Feed was completed once and then completely redone using different front-end technology. Andy began learning fullstack-javascript-based webdev in January 2017.

Andy worked with colleagues for initial project requirements, and received continuous feedback, but otherwise had full responsibility for this project. The large majority of the code was written by Andy.

The feed is an internal-only tool that our team uses daily to lay out goals, inform teammates of issues ad progress, and to reflect on the work. It is essentially a micro-blogging platform.

Screenshots of the production version are in `./screenshots`.

#### Changes to the portfolio version

This version of the code has had its proprietary dependencies and potentially-sensitive information removed. Code meant to build the production version of this project has also been removed. Some of those changes are likely functionality-breaking and may even completely break the build. Finally, this version is provided history-free (not Git repo) since the history may include proprietary and/or secret Butterscotch information.

Because of these changes, it should be expected that this project will not work as-is without debugging. That should not be taken to imply that the project doesn't work -- in the absence of these changes it works fine in production.
